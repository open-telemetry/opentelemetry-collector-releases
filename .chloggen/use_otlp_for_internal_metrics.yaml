  The collector supports exporting internal telemetry via Prometheus or using OTLP.
  The OTLP approach removes the need to bind a port for the Prometheus endpoint, and pushes
  metrics instead of holding them.
  The OTLP exporter associated with internal telemetry feeds data to the OTLP receiver of the collector.
