# OpenTelemetry Collector eBPF Profiling Distribution

This distribution is made specifically to be used as a node agent to gather
profiles on all processes running on the system.

It contains the [eBPF profiler
receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf-profiler) as
well as a subset of components from [OpenTelemetry Collector
Core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) and
[OpenTelemetry Collector
Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).

## Components

The full list of components is available in the [manifest](manifest.yaml).

### Rules for Component Inclusion

- Only includes components from Contrib and Core, except for the ebpf-profiler receiver.
- Only components that are Alpha or higher.
- All receivers must facilitate the collection and processing of data that is generated by the eBPF profiler.
- All components must be vendor-neutral.
- Only exporters that use OTLP are allowed.
 - To facilitate troubleshooting, the nop, debug, and file exporters are exceptions.
