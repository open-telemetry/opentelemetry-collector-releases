### ðŸ›‘ Breaking changes ðŸ›‘

- `releases`: Fix artifact checksum files being incomplete and split between Linux/Darwin and Windows. (#1002, #1086)
  This fixes a bug that occurred because releases for Windows and other Platforms are split.
  The Windows release always overwrote the checksum files already created for Linux and Darwin and so, only
  the Windows checksums were accessible in the end.
  
  This change is breaking because checksum files for Linux/Darwin and Windows are now split.
